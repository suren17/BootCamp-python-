Today's Exercise:
----------------
For your exercise I want you to build a simple calculator, the goal of this exercise is
to test your skill's as a programmer. I want you to code 4 functions:

def multiply(num_1, num_2): \\ This function must return the product of your two parameters

def divide(num_1, num_2): \\ This function must divide num_1 by num_2 and return the result

def remainder(num_1, num_2): \\ This function must return the remainder of num_1 divided by num_2

def power(num_1, num_2): \\ This function must return num_1 power by num_2


sample test's:
---------------
>>> multiply(2,3)
6
>>> divide(4,2)
2
>>> remainder(5,3)
1
>>> power(2,3)
8


Challenges:
------------
Challenges are not mandatory, but it is advised to do so in order to become a great python programmer.

I want you to code 2 functions:

def divisible_by_two(num_1): \\ returns true if num_1 divisible by 2

def divisible_by_three(num_1): \\ returns true if num_1 is divisible by 3

sample test's:
--------------
>>> divisible_by_two(10)
True
>>> divisible_by_two(9)
False

>>> divisible_by_three(9)
True
>>> divisible_by_three(10)
False
